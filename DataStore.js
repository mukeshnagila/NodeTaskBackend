        description: "While people were confined to their homes during the lockdown as a precautionary measure against the spread of COVID-19, social media became a platform for quick recipes, budding home chefs and the most popular- food bloggers. People who would have otherwise spent their time doing regular jobs began to, through their videos, entertain people and also showcase food trends in the city.",

        description: "We all lead busy lives, and it can be hard to remember to eat healthily. Sometimes, it’s easier to just grab food off the shelf, thinking only of the convenience and not of the nutritional value. Processed foods are always on-hand, which is why they make so much money for manufacturers. And they’ve saved us time and energy in the past. But, at what cost? ",

        description: "Diet cola portrays itself as a healthy alternative to regular cola. After all, it’s sugar-free! And, it has no calories. It’s often been the go-to drink for dieters everywhere. Though Mayo Clinic says that it is okay if consumed in minimal quantities, people who drink more than a can a day could be headed for some serious harm. According to Healthline, studies have shown that diet colas aren’t so “diet’ after all. Artificial sweeteners can lead to chronic kidney disease, tooth decay (because of the acidic pH level), and an increased risk of osteoporosis, depression, and heart disease. More studies are needed to be 100% sure, but you might want to cut back on diet cola or avoid it totally.",

        description: "Imitation cheese often has misleading packaging. These products, instead of being made with ingredients like milk fat the way normal cheese is, have vegetable oils, trans fats, flavorings, and preservatives. All of these ingredients make imitation cheeses much less healthy than real cheeses. You can identify imitation cheeses among other things, because they are considerably less expensive than real cheese.",

        description: "Chocolate-covered rice cereals are often advertised as a great option for the little ones to have breakfast. What is not advertised, of course, is that they are one of the most harmful cereals on the market. A single serving of this cereal provides between 55 and 73% of the total sugar recommended for children in a day. In addition, many of these types also have colorants associated with the development of hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders..",
